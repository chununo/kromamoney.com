== History ==

E2Pdf is the new and highly improved iteration of the [Formidable PRO2PDF plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidablepro-2-pdf/). Originally designed and coded in 2013 out of a need to print dynamic PDF documents from WordPress forms, PRO2PDF provided the automation necessary for a small insurance broker to produce far more business with the same number of employees.

Today, the E2Pdf plugin and Wordpress extension provide the entire WordPress community with a cost free method of creating dynamic PDF documents – without programming or coding – with one simple shortcode. More information can be found at [E2Pdf.com](https://e2pdf.com)
